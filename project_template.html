			<summary>Background</summary>
			<p class="project-background sub-content">
				The Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh was founded as a non-profit organization in 1981 to honor the 
				survivors  of  Pittsburgh  and  share  their  stories.  They  found  their  permanent  home  in  2015,  where 
				they hold a library, offices, and showcase for artifacts, class
				room, and multimedia gallery. With this 
				permanent space, the Holocaust Center has the opportunity to create and house original exhibitions, 
				as well as events that tailor to multiple interests, such as education, arts, and speaker series.

			<summary>Outcomes</summary>
			<p class="project-outcome sub-content">
				Our team created a check
				-in and analytics system for the center to keep track of visitors and view 
				information  about  events  and  visitors.  We  also  implemented  a  follow
				-up  email  system  to  give 
				visitors the option to complete their profile for more targeted events tailored toward their interests. 
				We created data analytic pages to include recommendations for the 
				best time to have events, which 
				will help with their operating hours and make staffing decisions. 
				We  also  worked  with  our  client  to  create  a  new  visitor  check
				-in  flow  to  make  transitioning  from 
				paper  to  digital  a  smooth  and  efficient  process.  By  creating 
				two  separate  flows  of  pre-registration 
				and  new  visitor,  we  were  able  to  test  our  newly  designed  process  at  an  event  with  over  400 
				attendees, helping them operate one of their smoothest check
				-in processes in the last couple years.  
				Additionally, our project 
				has helped with the center’s discussion about the possibility of creating a 
				membership  status  for  their  visitors,  as  they  would  be  able  to  appropriately  track  donor  status  and 
				event engagement.  
			</p>

		<details>
			<summary>Deliverables</summary>
			<p class="project-deliverable sub-content">
				Our  deliverables  include  a  hosted,  responsive  website  accessible  from  any  device,  documentation 
				for  staff  and  volunteer  members  on  how  to  operate  our  system,  and  recommendations  for  future 
				information system projects for the center. 
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Recommendations</summary>
			<p class="project-recommendation sub-content">
				The Holocaust Center should implement this 
				recommendation because the system reduces check
				-in 
				flow time, provides the opportunity to collect data about visitors and events, and most importantly, 
				help  the  center’s  director  make  holistic  decisions  based  on  these  analytics  that  would  be  much 
				harder to 
				be made with a paper system. In the long run, our system will increase visitor engagement, 
				providing reporting statistics for an increase of funding, and make staff processes more efficient.
