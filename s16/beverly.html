                Beverly’s Birthdays has grown exponentially over the past four years, a rate at which its current technology infrastructure cannot keep up with. The organization tracks amount of donations it receives using an Excel sheet and tracks inventory through memory, which was sufficient for daily operational needs in the past when it served only a small fraction of the population it does now. Manually tallying donations such as candy bars, big gifts, etc. is time-consuming and at times, takes an entire day. Since Excel only tracks inflow, there is no way of knowing how much of each item remains, which item donations are needed most or how many items are bought in addition to donations. Implementing an inventory management system will help Beverly’s Birthdays streamline internal operations so that it can save time and money with accurate inventory values, better communicate its needs to donors and volunteers and remain stable for the upcoming years.

                After understanding the core problem of our client and gathering requirements, we performed a comparative analysis of alternative solutions such as customizing an existing POS system, our team decided to build a custom Ruby on Rails web application that operates on a Postgres database, all deployed on Heroku and readily available on both desktop and mobile devices. We streamlined the inventorying process so that the check-in and check-out processes only require a simple barcode scan, implemented an advanced filter to facilitate item search, provided a dashboard with metrics such as number of birthday bins delivered to each agency, total bought and donated value and provided an export option so that other metrics that measure organizational performance can be evaluated in Excel with the data collected. To ensure sustainability of the project, we have provided extensive documentation and identified key personnel responsible for both the application and the code and worked weekly with our client to ensure that she has a thorough understanding of how to use the system.

            <p class="project-deliverable sub-content">
                The final application is deployed on Heroku and hosted at bbinnventory.herokuapp.com. Full ownership of the GitHub repository and Heroku server will be transferred to Beverly’s Birthdays. We have also created extensive application documentation and code documentation (including the ERD).
